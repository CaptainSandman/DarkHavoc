=========

Dark Havoc is a 2D side-scrolling arcade space shoot-em-up.

It's being written in C# using the XNA/MonoGame framework.

Platforms
-------

* Windows (100% Current, Backburner)
* Mac OS X (96% Current, Active)
* Linux (Planned)

Roadmap
-------

* Fix Mac OS X Specific Bugs
* Experiment with MonoGame-SDL2 (That might fix the aforementioned Mac OS X bugs)
* Finish implementing Practice Mode
    * Add Enemies
    * Add Instructions like "Use the arrow keys to move around!" and etc.
    * Make it a random but controlled environment for the player to practice in.
* Think of a story for the campaign.
* Remove unused code.
* Map out Achievements/Trophies
* Finish implementing RPG-style dialogue engine. Pretty crucial to Practice Mode.
* Architect/Design and implement a level format or research an existing one. Crucial for the *entire* game.
